them, and prepares them for full text search. Papermerge provides the look and feel
of modern desktop file browsers. It has features like dual panel document
browser, drag and drop, tags, hierarchical folders and full text search so that
you can efficiently store and organize your documents.

It supports PDF, TIFF, JPEG and PNG document file formats.
Papermerge is perfect tool for long term storage of your documents.

## Start with Docker

In order to start Papermerge App with the most basic setup use following command:

    docker run -p 8000:80 \
        -e PAPERMERGE__SECURITY__SECRET_KEY=abc \
        -e PAPERMERGE__AUTH__PASSWORD=123 \
        papermerge/papermerge:3.5

For more info about various docker compose scenarios check [documentation page](https://docs.papermerge.io/latest/setup/docker-compose/).

## Demo Page

Online demo is available at: https://demo.papermerge.com

```
Username: demo
Password: demo
```

Please note that, in order to save resources, online demo instance is deployed
using very basic setup: there is no OCR worker and no full text search engine
behind. Online instance is reseted every 24 hours (0:00 UTC timezone). Reset
means that all data is restored to initial state and all documents are deleted.

## Development

### Backend

Make sure you have installed [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) version 2.1.
Install all dependencies:

```
$ poetry install -E pg
```

Make sure you have the following environment variables set (e.g. with direnv):

```
export PAPERMERGE__DATABASE__URL=postgresql://coco:***@127.0.0.1:5432/pmgdb
export PAPERMERGE__MAIN__MEDIA_ROOT=/home/eugen/var/pmgdata
export PAPERMERGE__MAIN__API_PREFIX='/api'
```

Start BE with following command:

```
$ poetry run task server
```

This command will start BE server on localhost port 8000.
Access its swagger docs via `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Frontend

Switch to UI folder.

```
cd frontend/apps/ui
```

Create `.env.development.local` file with following content:

```
VITE_REMOTE_USER=admin
VITE_REMOTE_USER_ID=49e78737-7c6e-410f-ae27-315b04bdec69
VITE_REMOTE_GROUPS=admin
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_KEEP_UNUSED_DATA_FOR=1
```

Another vite variables you may consider:

* VITE_REMOTE_ROLES


Of course, you will need to adjust user ID, username to match your BE.

`VITE_KEEP_UNUSED_DATA_FOR` will cache data returned from BE for one second

Start FE:

```commandline
yarn dev
```

This command will start FE server on `http://localhost:5173/`
