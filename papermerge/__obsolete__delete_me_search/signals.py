        After node was moved to the new parent, we need to update all
        descendants of the new parent so that they will have correct breadcrumb.
        An example will help:

        - Inbox
            - bibliothek
                - some_doc_1.pdf (contains word 'books')
                - some_doc_2.pdf (contains word 'books')
        - Home
            - My documents

        If user now searches for word 'books', search engine will return
        two entries:

            some_doc_1.pdf with breadcrumb .index > bibliothek > some_doc_1.pdf
            some_doc_2.pdf with breadcrumb .index > bibliothek > some_doc_2.pdf

        However, if user moves both some_doc_1.pdf and some_doc_2.pdf to
        Home > My documents, then breadcrumb of the some_doc_1.pdf and
        some_doc_2.pdf changes as well. If we don't update index, then
        search results for word 'books' will return correctly the documents
        but the breadcrumbs will be as if the documents are still in Inbox.
        In other words, if we don't update the index, after the move, searching
        for word 'books' will reveal following entries:

            some_doc_1.pdf with breadcrumb .index > bibliothek > some_doc_1.pdf
            some_doc_2.pdf with breadcrumb .index > bibliothek > some_doc_2.pdf

        The results are correct, but their breadcrumb is wrong (outdated).

        In order to solve above described problem, we need to update index
        (which in turn will update breadcrumbs) of all descendant nodes
        of the new parent - which include newly moved nodes as well.
